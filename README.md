# react-redux-example
A Django project that shows the basics of React and Redux.

This project builds off of the [django-react-starterpack](https://github.com/kkworden/django-react-starterpack).

## Getting started
You will need:
* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv)
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

Clone the repository and `cd` into the directory.

Open a shell and run `pipenv install` to install the necessary Python dependencies.

Next, run `pipenv shell` to activate the virtual environment.

In a separate shell, run `npm run webpack` to start Webpack bundling.

You should be able to navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000. Happy coding!
